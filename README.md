# Mystic Woods Survivors

A vampire survivors-inspired game with toroidal (wrap-around) world mechanics, pixel-art graphics, and local multiplayer-ready design.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Mystic Woods Survivors is a fast-paced action roguelite where you survive endless waves of monsters by collecting experience, leveling up, and choosing powerful upgrades. The game features a unique wrapping world mechanic where the map edges connect like a torus (donut), creating interesting strategic possibilities for positioning and combat.

## 🌟 Features

- **Toroidal World**: The game world wraps both horizontally and vertically - move off one edge and appear on the opposite side
- **16 Unique Weapons**: Each with distinct mechanics and upgrade paths
- **11 Passive Items**: Stat boosts that synergize with your weapons
- **Pixel Art Graphics**: Custom 32x32 pixel-art sprites for all weapons and passives
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Increasingly challenging enemy waves with bosses
- **Local Co-op Ready**: Designed for easy addition of second player
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Move your character with WASD or arrow keys
2. Weapons auto-fire at nearby enemies
3. Collect experience gems from defeated enemies to level up
4. Choose upgrades when you level up to enhance your build
5. Survive as long as possible against increasingly difficult waves
6. When you die, spend collected gold on permanent upgrades (future feature)
